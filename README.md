Open-source | Built with ☕ using Nuxt, Supabase, and TailwindCSS

## ✨ Overview

TrackALL is a simple and intuitive platform for managing your side projects, tasks, and notes—all in one place. Whether you’re a solo developer or working with a team, TrackALL gives you the clarity you need to stay on top of things without the overwhelming complexity of other project management tools.

I built TrackALL to practice **Vue** and **Nuxt**, and to create a lightweight solution to track my own projects. The result is a free, open-source tool that’s perfect for developers who just want to focus on building, not managing complex workflows.

## 🌟 Features

- **Effortless Project Creation**: Quickly set up your projects with just a few clicks.
- **Task Tracking**: Create tasks, assign deadlines, and mark them as done once completed.
- **Note Management**: Add project notes to centralize ideas, feedback, and insights in one place.
- **Simple, Not Overwhelming**: Unlike other tools, TrackALL is designed to keep you focused on your projects, not the process.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Nuxt 3** - Frontend framework based on Vue.js, providing SSR, static site generation, and more.
- **Supabase** - Backend as a service for authentication and database management.
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs.
- **PrimeVue** - Feature-rich UI component library for Vue applications.
- **NuxtUI** - A clean, modern UI library for building interactive and responsive interfaces.
